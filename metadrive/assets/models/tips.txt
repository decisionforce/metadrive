If a gltf model lacks normal when using RenderPipeline, try:

1. blender open gltf files and save it to ../../textures (the same dir as this tips.txt file)
2. blend2egg: blend2egg ../beetle.blend -o test.egg
3. move egg file to ../textures dir 
4. cd to egg file dir
5. egg2bam ./beetle.egg -o vehicle.bam
6. compress textures
