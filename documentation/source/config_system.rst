Environment Configuration
##########################

.. warning:: This page is under construction!

A MetaDrive instance accepts a dict as the environmental config. For example, you can build a MetaDrive instance with 200 generated maps via

.. code-block:: python

    from metadrive import MetaDriveEnv
    config = dict(environment_num=200, start_seed=0)
    env = MetaDriveEnv(config)

    # or using gym interface:
    import gym
    env = gym.make("MetaDrive-v0", {"environment_num": 200, "start_seed": 0})

In this page, we describe the details of each configurable options.


Generalization Config
########################

MetaDrive can generate unlimited driving scenarios if using procedural generation.
We can specify the range of the scenarios used in different tasks.
For example, you can use different set of generated scenarios to train and test the trained agents.
To achieve that, you only need to specify the range of random seeds used to generated those scenarios.
Concretely, MetaDrive will use the seeds in range :code:`[start_seed, start_seed + environment_num)`.
Therefore, you only need to specify these two values in the config:

    - :code:`start_seed` (int = 0): Random seed of the first map.
    - :code:`environment_num` (int = 1): Number of the driving scenarios.


Agent Config
#############


    - :code:`num_agents` (int = 1):
    - :code:`is_multi_agent` (bool = False):
    - :code:`allow_respawn` (bool = False):
    - :code:`delay_done` (int = 0):
    - :code:`random_agent_model` (bool = False):
    - :code:`IDM_agent` (bool = False):


Action Config
##############

    - :code:`manual_control` (bool = False):
    - :code:`controller` (str = "keyboard"):
    - :code:`decision_repeat` (int = 5):
    - :code:`discrete_action` (bool = False):
    - :code:`discrete_steering/throttle_dim` (int = 5, 5):




Visualization & Rendering
###########################

    - :code:`use_render` (bool = False): Pop a window on your screen or not
    - :code:`debug` (bool = False): For developing use, draw the scene with bounding box
    - :code:`disable_model_compression` (bool = True): Model compression reduces the memory consumption when using Panda3D window to visualize. Disabling model compression greatly improves the launch speed but might cause breakdown in low-memory machine.
    - :code:`cull_scene` (bool = True): When you want to access the image of camera, it should be set to True.
    - :code:`use_chase_camera_follow_lane` (bool = False):
    - :code:`camera_height` (float = 1.8):
    - :code:`camera_dist` (float = 6.0):
    - :code:`prefer_track_agent` (str = None):
    - :code:`draw_map_resolution` (int = 1024):
    - :code:`top_down_camera_initial_x/y/z` (int = 0, 0, 200):


Vehicle Control
#################################

The following content is working in progress.


TrafficManager Config
##################################

    - :code:`traffic_density` (float): Vehicle number per 10 meter, aiming to adjust the number of vehicle on road
    - :code:`traffic_mode`: Trigger mode (Triger) / reborn mode (Reborn). In Reborn mode vehicles will enter the map again after arriving its destination.
    - :code:`random_traffic` (bool): the traffic generation will not be controlled by current map seed. If set to *False*, each map will have same traffic flow.

Map Config
##############################
    -   :code:`map` (int or string): You can set a *string* or *int* as the key to generate map in an easy way. An *int=N* means generating a map containing N blocks,
        and the block type is randomly selected. Since in MetaDrive each block has a unique ID in *char* type, *string* can determine the block type sequence.
        For example, "SCrRX" means the first block is Straight, and the next blocks are Circular, InRamp, OutRamp and Intersection.
        We provide the following block types:

            +---------------+-----------+
            | Block Type    |    ID     |
            +===============+===========+
            | Straight      |     S     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | Circular      |     C     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | InRamp        |     r     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | OutRamp       |     R     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | Roundabout    |     O     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | Intersection  |     X     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | TIntersection |     T     |
            +---------------+-----------+
            | Fork          |   (WIP)   |
            +---------------+-----------+


    - :code:`map_config` (dict): The original map config. Find more information in Map source code, or find usage in our test scripts.

        - :code:`type` (str): The map can be generated by BIG according to BLOCK_NUM, BLOCK_SEQUENCE, or MAP_FILE
        - :code:`config` (srt): A int telling BIG the total block number under BLOCK_NUM mode, or a str describing BLOCK_SEQUENCE
          (each block has a unique character severing as its ID, so combining them to get a map, the parameters of these block
          is sampled by BIG), and under MAP_FILE mode the config should be a dict describing the whole map.
        - :code:`lane_width` (float): Width of lanes.

Action Config
#######################

    - :code:`decision_repeat` (int): The minimal step size of the world is 2e-2 second, and thus for agent the world will step
