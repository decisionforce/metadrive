    "## Reward Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For all environments, reward functions consist of generally a dense driving reward and a sparse terminal reward. The dense reward is the longitudinal movement along the reference line or lane toward destination. When the episode is terminated due to, i.e. arriving the destination or driving out of the road, a sparse reward will be added to the dense reward. In practice, the concrete implementations of reward function are slightly different across all environments. \n",

    "### MetaDriveEnv\n",
    "The reward functions for the `MetaDriveEnv` and derived environments like `Multi-agent Environments` and `SafeMetaDriveEnv` are similar as they all using `PGMap`. The implementation is as follows."

    "This reward function is composed of six parts as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R = c_{1} R_{driving} + c_{2} R_{lateral} + c_{3} R_{heading} + c_{4} R_{steering} - c_{5} P_{collision} + R_{termination}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **driving reward** $R_{driving} = d_t - d_{t-1}$, wherein the $d_t$ and $d_{t-1}$ denote the longitudinal movements of the target vehicle on the recorded trajectory of two consecutive time steps, providing dense reward to encourage agent to move toward the destination.\n",
    "- The **lateral reward** $R_{lateral}$ incentives the agent to driving as close to the reference trajectory as possible. When the distance between the car and the reference trajectory is larger than `max_lateral_dist`, the episode will be terminated due to driving out of road. \n",
    "- The **heading reward** $R_{heading}$ asks the agent to have the same heading as the direction of a certain point on the lane. The point is calculated per step by projecting the position of the vehicle to the reference line (recorded trajectory). \n",
    "- The **steering reward** $R_{steering}$ is for yielding large steering actions when the speed is high. The higher the speed is, the larger the penalty for the large steering angle will be.\n",
    "- The **collision penalty** $P_{collision}$ is a constant scalar for penalizing any collision behaviors with certain type of traffic participants.\n",
    "- The **termination reward** $R_{termination}$ contains a set of sparse rewards. At the end of episode, other dense rewards will be disabled and only one sparse reward will be given to the agent at the end of the episode according to its termination state. We use the `success_reward`, `out_of_road_penalty` for this environment. The penalty will be given as negative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a special config `no_negative_reward`. When setting it to `True`, the final reward will be clipped to `reward=max(reward, 0)`. This is helpful for stabilizing the training. We summarize the default reward config of the `ScenarioEnv` here:\n",

    "3. the vehicle crashes to other vehicles,\n",

    "\n",
    "Please note that in the Safe RL environment `SafeMetaDriveEnv <https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive/blob/main/metadrive/envs/safe_metadrive_env.py>`_, the episode will not be terminated when vehicles crashing into objects or vehicles.\n",
    "This is because we wish to investigate the safety performance of a vehicle in an extremely dangerous environments.\n",
    "Terminating episodes too frequently will let the training becomes too hard to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Multi-agent environment, the above termination criterion is still hold for each vehicle. We call this the termination of an *agent episode*.\n",
    "We explicitly add two config to adjust the termination processing in MARL: `crash_done = True` and `out_of_road_done = True`.\n",
    "They denotes whether to terminate the agent episode if crash / out of road happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, in Multi-agent environment, the controllable target vehicles consistently respawn in the scene if old target vehicles are terminated.\n",
    "To limit the length of *environmental episode*, we also introduce a config `horizon = 1000` in MARL environments.\n",
    "The environmental episode has a **minimal length** of `horizon` steps and the environment will stop spawning new target vehicles if this horizon is exceeded.\n",
    "If you wish to disable the respawning mechanism in MARL, set the config `allow_respawn = False`. In this case, the environmental episode will terminate if no active vehicles are in the scene.\n",
