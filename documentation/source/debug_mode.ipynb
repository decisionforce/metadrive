    "It is important to making sure that physics world is accurate. For example, objects need bounding box to collide with each other. Specifying `debug=True` in environment config can turn on the debug mode. In this mode, you can visualize the physics world by pressing `1` (the one near `~`) on your keyboard. In the following example, we automatically turn on the physics world visualizer for you. Pressing `1` can turn if off. Besides, the `log_level` will be changed to `logging.DEBUG`, so you will get more information from MetaDrive, Panda3D, and RenderPipeline."

    "The default debug mode only visualizes what we called `dynamics physics world`. In this world, objects can have interactions conforming the physics law like collision, friction, and gravity. Actually, there is another physics world called `static physics world` where objects won't participate in collision and enjoy zero gravity. However, one can still query this world to know if an object in `dynamics physics world` has contact with objects in the `static physics world`. Thus we usually put objects like crosswalks, lane lines and lanes in this world. As a result, we can know which lane the car is on or if it is on a lane line or sidewalk, while keep the simulation at a high FPS as we only step the `dynamics physics world`.\n",

You will also experience a FPS drop, which is why we separate the physics world into two."
