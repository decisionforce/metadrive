    "- assets: it is downloaded from github releases automatically, containing models, textures, and mini-batch real-world scenarios\n",
    "- base_class: meta-classes for making other python classes, usually you don't need to modify it\n",
    "- component: objects/vehicles/maps/lanes, almost all elements used for constructing scenario is here\n",
    "- engine: it contains code regarding the simulation loop, asset manager/loader, physics system, logger, skybox, shadow and so on\n",
